# Environment Constraints & Command Syntax

You are operating in a **PowerShell** environment on Windows. These constraints will save you time and prevent execution errors.

## Command Chaining

PowerShell uses semicolons (`;`) instead of ampersands (`&&`) for command chaining.

**INCORRECT:**
```powershell
git add . && git commit -m "message" && git tag exp_01
```

**CORRECT:**
```powershell
git add .; git commit -m "message"; git tag exp_01
```

---

## Multi-line Git Commits

PowerShell struggles with Bash-style heredocs and complex quoting for multi-line strings.

**AVOID (will fail in PowerShell):**
```powershell
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Multi-line
message
here
EOF
)"
```

**USE INSTEAD:**

Option 1 - Single line:
```powershell
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

Option 2 - Multiple `-m` flags:
```powershell
git commit -m "Feature: Title" -m "Description line 1" -m "Description line 2"
```

## Python Execution & UTF-8 Output

Some Python scripts output UTF-8 characters (checkmarks ✓, progress bars, unicode symbols).

**What might happen:** You'll see encoding errors like `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character`.

**What to do:** Ignore console errors and read the output files directly. The script usually completes successfully and saves all results to JSON files regardless of the encoding warning.

**Example:**
```
UnicodeEncodeError in console output
→ Check evaluation_results/results_exp_XX.json
→ Results are there, complete and usable
```

## File Verification

After running experiments or making changes, verify files actually updated:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path evaluation_results/ | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object Name, LastWriteTime
```

This shows you the most recent files and their timestamps, confirming that your run actually saved results.
