## The Problem We're Solving

### Before This System:
[YOUR PROJECT: List the manual, painful, or error-prone steps that exist today.]

1. Step one of the current painful process
2. Step two...
3. ...

### After This System:
[YOUR PROJECT: List the streamlined steps after your system exists.]

1. Simplified step one
2. ...

## How It Works: The User Flow

[YOUR PROJECT: Walk through the system from the user's perspective, step by step.
Be concrete — name actual UI elements, file formats, triggers, and outputs.]

### Step 1: [Action Name]
[Description]

### Step 2: [Action Name]
[Description]

*(Continue for all steps)*
